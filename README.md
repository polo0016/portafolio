My Portafolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 

With this page, I want to demonstrate my abilities to design a user-friendly website as well as my ability to code it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and public libraries like Bootstrap

The Process

My biggest goal for this assignment was to make the website as close as possible to the design I had created, not knowing I would have to code it. I want it to look as professional as possible, so I spend a lot of time inspecting other websites and watching YouTube videos to learn how to code every element. I also challenged myself to use other options for my design instead of just relying on Grid and flex. 

When I started to map out the design and how I would design it, I felt really overwhelmed because the mobile design was very different from the website. And I felt thought that it was going would take me more time on the desktop. So, contrary to what my professors have taught me, I started my code with the desktop version. I know it is not the usual way, but it was the most efficient way in my head to tackle this design. 


I did a crash course on bootstrap  and Java with the following videos with this video

I learned how important it was to have an organized code, and I know from a video that some people like to put the media queries on a separate CSS document, which I thought was terrific because it allowed me to have the style sheet on one side and start typing the media queries on another one. I felt like it was way more organized this way. This helped significantly because I first began coding the desktop version. 

I learn about the “!important” tag that overrules others. At the end of my styling process, I had trouble with some things staying the way I wanted them, especially after doing the media queries. So watching some YouTube videos, I learned that I could use this tag, so no matter what, this style would be predominant throughout the page. 


Finally, I would appreciate it if you could look at [my first attempt to create a website](https://polo0016.github.io/mtm6201-midterm/). For that first project, I couldn’t fully recreate the design, and I was struggling with the menu placement because I was using a grid and flex.  With this website, I achieved a similar design by going out of my comfort zone and exploring other methods to display my design.
